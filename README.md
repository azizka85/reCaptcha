# How it works
On the home page:
- set "Site key" field to get token
- set "Secret key" field to verify token
- if url to get token was changed then you need to change "Url to generate token" field, where {site-key} is the input element with id "site-key"
- if url to verify token was changed then you need to change "Url to verify token" field
